## Interesting Article on Software Development
I found an interesting article about Agile Development:  
[Agile Software Development - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)


### Why I Found This Interesting
I find this fascinating because **Agile** ensures **adaptability** in software projects, allowing for quick responses to changing requirements and user feedback.

Unlike traditional **Waterfall** methods, where development follows a strict fixed process, **Agile**:
- Emphasizes **flexibility** and **continuous feedback**.
- Uses **incremental improvements** to reduce project failures.
- Helps teams **identify and fix issues early**, preventing costly mistakes.
